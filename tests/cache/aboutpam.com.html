<h2 class="blog-post-title">The &quot;right&quot; diet - what does that even mean</h2>
<p class="blog-post-meta">
<span>15. Dezember 2017</span>&middot;
Pamela</p>
<div class="blog-post-text"><img alt="aboutpam" data-ce-max-width="1240" height="260" src="https://images.aboutpam.com/uploads/posts/images/1/1_original_THERIGHTDIET_HEADER_EN.jpg.jpg" width="646">
<p>
A big part of my job - and a lot of what I strive to put out there as my message - revolves around fitness and the right diet. Two things that I believe are inseparable. Yet, a lot of people ask me what that actually means to me - „the right diet“. Ist there such a thing as right or wrong when it comes to food? Is „healthy“ the only criteria for a „good diet“? What do I look out for when it comes to food and what do I think is important?
</p>
<p>
I’ve been interested in healthy eating for a while now. Not long after I started lifting weights regularly I realized that I would have to adapt my eating habits in order to see results. For me, changing to a healthy diet wasn’t too big of a adjustment - I’ve been eating relatively healthy for as long as I can remember (thaaaanks mom &amp; dad). But I still had to accept that eating a piece of marble cake with my bowl of musli every morning (and yes, I mean every morning) wasn’t going to get me the results I was hoping for. Also, I might have to add, I used to be one of those people that could eat whatever they like without gaining weight - a so called „ectomorph“. I’ve always been relatively skinny - however, that’s one of the main reasons I had to adjust my diet to my new lifestyle: to make sure I was eating enough calories from the right foods in order to gain muscle and not lose weight.
</p>
<p>
Today, a few years from when I started out, I still eat a lot - firstly, because I just love food and I love fueling my body. Secondly, because I’m still training a lot and trying to reach my physical goals. That requires me to eat a certain amount of calories every day. However I feel like my metabolism changed a bit and I don't eat aaaas much as back then. And that also doesn’t mean I eat everything in sight, no matter how healthy or unhealthy. I still try to maintain a healthy and balanced diet most of the time. Therefore I don’t really care for diets, like the whole „low carb“ or „no fat“ thing. Instead, I try to fuel my body with what it needs and not deprive it of anything - including a good amount of carbohydrates, healthy fats and a sufficient amount of protein.
</p>
<p>
However, when it comes to the foods I consume there are other aspects I pay attention to besides their nutritional value. One of those aspects is <b>sustainability</b>. The more I was dealing with nutrition, the more I realized something very important: „the right diet“ isn’t just about me and my body. Sure, a major part of how and what we eat is to fulfill our individual needs and to keep our bodies working. But there’s another aspect we should consider: the choices we make everyday, especially when it comes to what we consume, impact our environment, and ultimately this planet, in ways most of us can’t even imagine. That’s why for me, „eating right“ is just as much about making choices that are sustainable and that do as little harm to our planet as possible. So if you have the resources and the capacities to adjust your diet to your own needs and preferences, you should absolutely be able to make choices that are sustainable as well.
</p>
<p>
<b>I am certainly not perfect in that regard</b>: for example, there is so much science out there that proves that meat consumption in industrialized countries is directly related to climate change. Personally, I still eat meat - but I do try to keep the major part of my diet plant-based. And I can see it in my surroundings, too: a lot of people are trying to make their diets more sustainable by consuming less and less meat products. Take my brother for example: just like me he’s neither a vegetarian, nor a vegan. He has, however, recently stopped consuming beef. Why? Studies that prove the impact of animal agriculture on our planet have shown that beef is actually the most problematic. The reason for that is simply that out of all other animals, cows require the most livestock feed, produce the most methane and are therefore responsible for extremely high carbon dioxide emissions. Of course by now most people are aware that meat consumption in general is hurting our climate and our planet. Animal agriculture is responsible for 80 to 90 percent of water consumption, it’s the leading cause for rainforest destruction and it is directly responsible for the destruction of ecosystems and natural resources.
</p>
<p>
Even though I’m not a vegetarian myself, I am aware of the fatal consequences of frequent meat consumption. In my opinion this is where everybody’s personal responsibility starts. Of course everyone is free to chose how they want to live their life and/or what they want to eat. However, it is not at all difficult to take little steps towards a sustainable lifestyle - even if that means having one or two meatless days per week, or making more conscious choices when buying meat products (like buying organic meat only). <b>Just because you’re not implementing something a hundred percent, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be doing small things to create an impact.</b> We can all contribute in some way, with a little effort and a few changes here and there :)
</p>
<p>
For me, another one of these small efforts is making sure I buy food that is made sustainably. When I shop for food, one of the things that are most important to me is knowing where my food comes from and how it was made. I try to buy <b>organic</b> and <b>seasonal foods</b> whenever I can. If I have the luxury, I prefer buying my fruits and vegetables, and especially meat products, at our local Saturday- market or at the nearest organic store. Again, this is not about being perfect and being one hundred percent consistent - sometimes I’ll buy raspberries in November and I regularly eat bananas (which, as most of us will know, don’t grow in Germany). It’s not the twenty percent of time where you don’t implement something that are crucial - it’s the other eighty percent where you try your best to live your daily life as consciously and sustainably as possible.
</p>
<p>
Even though organic foods aren’t necessarily healthier than regular foods, there are a few reasons why I prefer buying them: a lot of the time organic foods are less contaminated with pesticides and their growing is done much more sustainably, as is the animal agriculture. Of course it’s important to know that organic doesn’t automatically mean organic (confusing, I know). There is a variety of different organic-seals. Not every organic seal on a product speaks for a higher quality of the product. However, there are certain organic seals where you can be sure that the products have to withhold high standards. In Germany, some of the reliable organic food associations include „Bioland“, „Demeter“ and „Naturland“. They require higher standards than foods that are produced under the regular european organic seal, where the products only have to withhold basic standards to carry the seal. Let me stress this point again, it’s really not about being perfect! I’m also aware that organic products are often a lot more expensive than regular ones. But still you can take little steps in the right direction and try to support organic brands. Especially if you do have the resources and maybe some financial wiggle room. Even if you can’t afford shopping at organic stores only: many of the big supermarket chains have their own organic lines that are really reasonably priced. In that case, check how reliable the organic seal of that supermarket is and whether their organic products are actually produced under higher standards than regular products - which is not always true. But it can be worth it to do a little research and to spend your money on products and foods that have been produced sustainably and eco-friendly.
</p>
<p>
For me personally, „eating right“ doesn’t just mean eating healthy foods that nourish my body (even though that is certainly a major part of it). Eating right also means doing as little harm to the environment and our planet as possible and creating a positive impact with small things, such as our food choices. I’ve said it many times and I’ll say it again: I’m not trying to be perfect here and I don’t think anyone has to be - this is not an „all or nothing“ kind of thing. I’m convinced that little things you do in your daily life will have the biggest impact in the long run - such as more awareness when it comes to how we buy and consume foods. Especially if more and more people start thinking about what changes they can make in their lives to live just a tiny little bit more sustainably. Doesn’t matter if that is reducing your meat consumption, buying more seasonal &amp; organic food, riding your bike to work instead of taking the car or tell others about what you've learned. I believe that most people have the option to create a positive impact - in whatever way that may be.

Dear Pam,
I read your post and I just wanted to tell you that it’s great that you want to eat as sustainable as possible and make the world a better place by buying organic and seasonal food. Its not proven that organic food is healthier than non-organic food. However, it is true that the production of products that carry demeter or the EU organic logo requires higher standards and are therefore better for the environment. Thats not the case with all organic products. It is more important to buy regional products.
There is one thing I’d also like to add. I like your style and your instagram profile. But if you really want to live sustainably you maybe shouldn’t spend so much money on clothes that are produced in china or whereever wher people are exploited. You also shouldn’t take the plane as often as you do and therefore travel less because this has an enormous impact on the earth. I know that our world is a consumer world and I buy clothes made in China as well. However I dont consume them like a crazy person and I take the bike to every place I’m going (exept its further away than 15km) all year long. When I take the plane it’s worth it, meaning that I stay for long time at that place, not only a week or two.
So living sustainably doesn’t only concern your diet but also a lot more. I know that it is hard since we’re living in a consumer world.

Hey, erstmal super Beitrag und gut, dass du auf das Thema aufmerksam machst :)
Ich hab eine Frage, die sich eher auf den Anfang bezieht, wo du erwähnst, dass du einen guten Stoffwechsel hast und deinen Körper gezielt für den Muskelaufbau passend ernährst. Woher kam dann der Gedanke für die Saftkur? Die ist zum Abnehmen gedacht soweit ich weiß, oder?

Loved the post! I liked your healthy opinion about food and environmental problems. But I&#39;m concerned about your protein consumption. Do you count how much proteins you eat? You have kind of muscular body and everyone has the opinion, that for muscles you have to eat a lot of proteins. Is it true? What works for you? How you get your proteins without meat?

Hey liebe pam. Sehr interessanter artikel. Jedoch stimmt das mit den Körpertypen nicht. Ich studiere psychologie und die drei Körperformen zu denen dein oben genanntes ektomorph zählt gibt es gar nicht (wurde schon seit jahrzenten widerlegt). Normerweise würde ich deswegen nicht kommentieren aber der wissenschaftler dahinter hat jedem dieser formen noch teilweise ziemlich vorurteilsbehaftete eigenschaften zugeschrieben.

Liebe Pamela,
Dein Text hat es meiner Meinung nach auf den Punkt gebracht. Viele Menschen Leben leider nach dem Motto &quot;ganz oder gar nicht&quot; und denken, weil sie auf eine kleine Sache &quot;sowieso nicht verzichten&quot; können, brauchen sie gar nicht erst damit anfangen.
Somit freue ich mich sehr, dass du das Thema Nachhaltigkeit, in vorallem diesem Zusammenhang, ansprichst
und somit hoffentlich eine Menge lieber Menschen erreichst.
Viel Spaß und Glück wünsche ich dir weiterhin, auf deinem Weg der Nachhaltigkeit 😛🤗

Da hast du total recht! Ich finde auch dass es wichtig ist einfach bewusst zu essen, einzukaufen und damit bewusst zu leben.
Ich habe erst vor kurzen eine Reportage “Hühner für die Dritte Welt” auf ARD gesehen. Es ist leider auch sehr erschreckend was mit den europäischen Hühnerabfällen passiert und was sie schlimmes in ärmeren Ländern anstellen...
Keiner muss meiner Meinung auf Fleisch verzichten, aber es wäre wichtig wenn sich jeder anschaut wo sein Fleisch herkommt und unter welchen Bedingungen die Tiere leben mussten.
Toller Beitrag Pam! Wenn jeder mit sich selbst anfängt, dann bewirken wir großes! :)

Toller Post, Pamela!
Ich finde es super, dass du deine Reichweite auch dafür nutzt um auf die Umweltprobleme, die mit unserer Ernährung in Verbindung stehen aufmerksam zu machen!

Ich finde,dass jeder etwas zur Unwelt Beitragen könnte.Viele aber denken nicht Dran oder sind auch zu faul um z.B. mit Fahrrad zu fahren):aber wenn man selber etwas dafür macht hat man direkt ein besseres Gefühl:)

Hallo liebe Pamela :) mir ist es schon durch deine Stories, Posts und das Buch aufgefallen, dass du auf solche Dinge achtest und das finde ich sehr toll! Das ist mit einer deiner besten blogposts bisher, weil er so wichtig und sinnvoll ist. Gerade das jüngere Publikum kann durch solche Anstöße viel bewegen :) mir hätte nur noch ein bisschen das Thema Verpackung gefehlt. Bei einem markteinkauf und im Bioladen kann man natürlich einfach seine Beutel mitbringen aber im Supermarkt ist doch sehr viel Plastik (eben gerade um verarbeitete Produkte) mit dabei. Müll, vor allem Plastik ist ja auch nicht nachhaltig und zerstört unsere Umwelt und vor allem die Meere 😞🐳. Ich persönlich lebe zu 90% Vegan &amp; versuche das 2018 noch mehr auszubauen. Weniger Ausnahmen :) aktuell befasse ich mich auch mit dem Thema Konsum, Zero Waste etc. Und möchte jetzt weniger aber bessere Qualität konsumieren. Gerade auch bei Lebensmitteln. Es wird so viel weggeworfen - für das Geld hätt ich dann zb eine bio orange unverpackt bekommen statt 3 verpackte normale wovon 1-2 nicht gegessen werden. Ich glaube es ist wichtig dass wir uns alle damit auseinander setzen, denn sonst geht unser Planet irgendwann daran kaputt. Vor jedem Kauf noch mal nachdenken: will und brauche ich das jetzt wirklich? Kann Ich langfristig eine bessere Version dieses Produktes kaufen? ...
Danke für deinen Beitrag :) Lg Kati (@katinspo) ❤️

Wie ca. 10x erwähnt: ich bin kein perfektes Vorbild, aber ich versuche mein Bestes! Ich fliege nicht wahllos durch die Gegend, sondern nur für bezahlte Projekte. Das ist nunmal mein Job und nach Amerika schwimmen kann ich ja schlecht :) innerhalb Deutschland oder nach Frankreich nehme ich zB auch so oft wie möglich den Zug! Doch nur weil ich mich in diesem Bereich nicht vorbildlich verhalte, heißt es doch noch lange nicht, dass ich deshalb auf die anderen Bereiche - für die ich etwas tun kann - keinen Wert mehr legen sollte? Verstehe deine Logik leider nicht ganz Erika. LG

Hi liebe Pamela, toll dass darüber sprichst, und nicht wie viele andere ständig nur über fashion etc. postet, vor allem da auch die fashion industrie sehr umweltschädigend ist, auch würde mich deine meinung zum thema pestizide interessieren. ich ernähre mich sehr viel pflanzlich, nun lese ich immer mehr artikel wie auch unsere lebensmittel krebserregend sein können, aufgrund von düngemittel, spritzmittel etc... - ich würde mich freuen, wenn Du auf meine Nachricht antwortest, liebe grüße mai

Hey,
Ich finde sehr interessant, was du zum Thema Ernährung geschrieben hast. Mir fällt es sehr schwer eine Linie zu finden zu wissen wie kann ich mich gut ernähren ohne zuzunehmen. Hast du da einen Tipp? Ich esse auch wirklich gerne ungesundes Zeug Grad wenn ich in der Prüfungsphase bin 🙈

Hey Pam,
ich liebe deine blog, vor allem auch auf insta!
ich selber fand den beitrag sehr interessant, und versuch mich auch schon viel von vornherein dran zu halten! das mit den verschiedenen siegeln war ein sehr guter tipp von dir! ich leider kann kein fleisch essen, nicht aus tierliebe, sondern weil ich es einfach nicht vertrage, aber hey, so trag ich was zur nachhaltigkeit bei!😅 ich hoffe wir hören noch viel viel mehr von dir 🌸

Hey Pam!😊 Ich würde irgendwie gerne Vegetarierin werden. Leider ist meine Familie so “normal“, da gibts keinen Vegetarier oder Veganer oder welche die viel Sport machen. Und die ganze Zeit für das Angestarrt zu werden was man tut ist auch nicht sooo toll😞 Tipp?❤

Liebe Pamela,
ich verfolge dich schon sehr lang. Zuerst habe ich dich irgendwann auf Instagram entdeckt, da warst du gerade in der Abiturphase. Du bist zu so einem tollen Vorbild für so viele Menschen geworden! :)
Ich studiere an der TU Dresden Kommunikationswissenschaften und vielleicht könnten du und deine Community mir und meiner Forschungsgruppe helfen, indem ihr bei unsere Umfrage zur Nutzung von Instagram und persönlichen Blogs mitmacht.

Hi Pamela, auch wenn du dies hier möglicherweise garnicht ließt, ist es mir gerade wirklich wichtig dir zu sagen wie gut und wichtig ich es finde wenn Menschen im öffentlichen Leben die einen bestimmten gedanklichen Horizont wie du ihn mit diesem Text gezeigt hast, ihre Einstellung teilen und andere aufklären. Ich selber bin gerade mal 17 und lebe seit einiegen Jahren nachhaltig, zumindestens gebe ich mein bestes und versuche mich stätig zu steigern. Bei dieser Steigerung hilfst auch Du mir, denn mit deinen Beiträgen und Produktempfehlungen, wie zum Beispiel heute einer Kerze ohne Palmöl, machst du mir mein Leben einfacher, da ich auch besonders darauf achte und bestimmte alltägliche Produkte zu finden, die meiner Einstellung entsprechen ist nicht immer leicht. Also vielen Dank dafür...mach bitte weiter so...Liebe Grüße :)
