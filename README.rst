Find **original and updated publication dates** of any web page. **On the command-line or with Python**, all the steps needed from web page download to HTML parsing, scraping, and text analysis are included. The package is used in production on millions of documents and integrated by `multiple libraries <https://github.com/adbar/htmldate/network/dependents>`_.

With Python
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from htmldate import find_date
    >>> find_date('http://blog.python.org/2016/12/python-360-is-now-available.html')
    '2016-12-23'

On the command-line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    $ htmldate -u http://blog.python.org/2016/12/python-360-is-now-available.html
    '2016-12-23'


Features
--------

- Flexible input: URLs, HTML files, or HTML trees can be used as input (including batch processing).
- Customizable output: Any date format (defaults to `ISO 8601 YMD <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_).
- Detection of both original and updated dates.
- Multilingual.
- Compatible with all recent versions of Python.


How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Htmldate operates by sifting through HTML markup and if necessary text elements. It features the following heuristics:

1. **Markup in header**: Common patterns are used to identify relevant elements (e.g. ``link`` and ``meta`` elements) including `Open Graph protocol <http://ogp.me/>`_ attributes.
2. **HTML code**: The whole document is searched for structural markers like ``abbr`` or ``time`` elements and a series of attributes (e.g. ``postmetadata``).
3. **Bare HTML content**: Heuristics are run on text and markup:
   - In ``fast`` mode the HTML page is cleaned and precise patterns are targeted.
   - In ``extensive`` mode all potential dates are collected and a disambiguation algorithm determines the best one.


Finally, the output is validated and converted to the chosen format.

Author

This project is part of methods to derive information from web documents in order to build `text databases for research <https://www.dwds.de/d/k-web>`_ (chiefly linguistic analysis and natural language processing).

Extracting and pre-processing web texts to meet the exacting standards is a significant challenge. It is often not possible to reliably determine the date of publication or modification using either the URL or the server response. For more information:
