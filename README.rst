With Python:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from htmldate import find_date
    >>> find_date('http://blog.python.org/2016/12/python-360-is-now-available.html')
    '2016-12-23'

On the command-line:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ htmldate -u http://blog.python.org/2016/12/python-360-is-now-available.html
    '2016-12-23'


Features
--------

-  Multilingual, robust and efficient (used in production on millions of documents)
-  URLs, HTML files, or HTML trees are given as input (includes batch processing)
-  Output as string in any date format (defaults to `ISO 8601 YMD <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_)
-  Detection of both original and updated dates
-  Compatible with all recent versions of Python


``htmldate`` can examine markup and text. It provides the following ways to date an HTML document:

1. **Markup in header**: Common patterns are used to identify relevant elements (e.g. ``link`` and ``meta`` elements) including `Open Graph protocol <http://ogp.me/>`_ attributes
2. **HTML code**: The whole document is searched for structural markers: ``abbr`` or ``time`` elements and a series of attributes (e.g. ``postmetadata``)
3. **Bare HTML content**: Heuristics are run on text and markup:

  - in ``fast`` mode the HTML page is cleaned and precise patterns are targeted
  - in ``extensive`` mode all potential dates are collected and a disambiguation algorithm determines the best one

Finally the output is validated and converted to the chosen format.

Author
------

This effort is part of methods to derive information from web documents in order to build `text databases for research <https://www.dwds.de/d/k-web>`_ (chiefly linguistic analysis and natural language processing). Extracting and pre-processing web texts to the exacting standards of scientific research presents a substantial challenge for those who conduct such research. There are web pages for which neither the URL nor the server response provide a reliable way to find out when a document was published or modified. For more information:
